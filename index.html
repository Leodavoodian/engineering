    <<h3>Week 2: For week two we just began on our websites and learned how to use 
    them. It was going really well and I was having a good time. I started working 
    on making my website look good, and so far so good.</h3>
    
    <h4>  Week 3: Well this week in class we began a project on tinkercad, 
    and we had to design a ruth goldberg machine on the website and then eventually 
    recreate it in the classroom. Before we did that, we had to create a recreation of 
    a photo we had. I used a photo of my shoes when I first got them. It turned out pretty
    good, but not the best. After that the next class we began our ruth goldberg
    machine project. That was my week 3.</h4>

    <h4> Week 4: In week 3 we finished the ruth goldberg proect on tinkercad and we began to recreate
    it in real life. We started with a ramp on Wednesday, and on friday we ended
    with a ramp, a platform, 4 poles, and all we had to is assemble it. </h4>
    
    
    
    <h4> Week 5: During week 5 we had some more time to work on our 
    projects. After the final touches were finished, we began 
    testing our projects. Ours failed the first day. The second day we 
    got the baloon to pop. It was fun having fun with my group mates
    and seeing our machine in action. </h4>
    
  <h4> Week 6: During this week, we were tasked with disecting a laptop.
  My partner Dylan and I took the computer apart and had to put it back 
  together. We had some minor mistakes, which did not turn out amazing. 
  We messed up, and it took us two days in class. In the end it was 
  fun hanging out tearing apart a computer with Dylan.</h4>
    
  <h4> Week 7: This week, we started working on a prosthetic for an animal. 
  I chose the Belgian Malinois. It is a fierce dog, but at the same time 
  can be very loving. I made a prosthetic for its front leg on tinkercad. 
  Here it is !</h4>
  
<h4> Week 8: On the first day of the week we learned about aerospace 
engineering. We saw how the National Space station was built and 
what it's made of and who was apart of it. It was really cool. On the
second day we had to make a flying paper and throw it into a trash can 
off of a building. It was interesting and fun. We also began to create 
dimensions for our bottle rocket projects and work on our websites.</h4>
