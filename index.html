    <<h3>Week 2: For week two we just began on our websites and learned how to use 
    them. It was going really well and I was having a good time. I started working 
    on making my website look good, and so far so good.</h3>
    
    
    <h4>  Week 3: Well this week in class we began a project on tinkercad, 
    and we had to design a ruth goldberg machine on the website and then eventually 
    recreate it in the classroom. Before we did that, we had to create a recreation of 
    a photo we had. I used a photo of my shoes when I first got them. It turned out pretty
    good, but not the best. After that the next class we began our ruth goldberg
    machine project. That was my week 3.</h4>
    
    <h4> Week 4: In week 3 we finished the ruth goldberg proect on tinkercad and we began to recreate
    it in real life. We started with a ramp on Wednesday, and on friday we ended
    with a ramp, a platform, 4 poles, and all we had to is assemble it. </h4>
